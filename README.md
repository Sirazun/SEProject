Shaik Sirazun Group Number-27 Project Name: Life Below Water

**Problem Statement**
"Life Below Water," focuses on conserving and sustainably using the world's oceans, seas, and marine resources. This goal is crucial because oceans play a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate, providing food and livelihoods, and supporting biodiversity. Human activities like pollution, overfishing, and climate change are harming marine ecosystems, and SDG 14 aims to reverse these negative trends. 
**Objective**
Climate Regulation:
Oceans absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and play a key role in regulating global temperatures. 
Food Security:
Marine resources provide a crucial source of protein for billions of people worldwide. 
Biodiversity:
Oceans are home to an incredible diversity of life, with an estimated 50-80% of all life on Earth found under the ocean surface. 
Livelihoods:
Many communities rely on healthy oceans for their livelihoods through fishing, tourism, and other related activities. 
**Key Modules**
Pollution:
Plastic waste, chemical runoff, and other forms of pollution are contaminating marine environments and harming marine life. 
Overfishing:
Unsustainable fishing practices are depleting fish populations and disrupting marine ecosystems. 
Ocean Acidification:
Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans, making them more acidic and harming marine organisms, especially those with shells or skeletons. 
Climate Change:
Rising ocean temperatures and sea-level rise are impacting marine habitats and species. 
**Development**
Sustainable Fisheries:
Implementing sustainable fishing practices to prevent overfishing and protect fish stocks. 
Reduce Pollution:
Reducing plastic waste, chemical runoff, and other forms of pollution entering the ocean. 
Combat Climate Change:
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the ocean. 
Marine Protected Areas:
Establishing and effectively managing marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity and protect critical habitats. 
International Cooperation:
Working together to address global challenges like overfishing and pollution. 
In essence, SDG 14 calls for a global effort to protect the health and sustainability of our oceans for present and future generations.
